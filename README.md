# Bash Koans Exercise Details
Arithmetic:
- echo command will copy all contents of the exact string, including spaces.
Conditionals:
- Consider using $x when determining the value or condition it is.
- The quotations don't matter for conditions and variables.
- Can consider multiple cases on checking the value of local variable test.
- Can consider using -_ to check if something we need exists (files, directories).
About pipe:
- To substitute or pipeline old variables with new ones, we can use s/old/new.
Redirection:
- Consider using > to direct some output or result to a file or text.
- Consider using 2> to redirect standard errors to a file or text. 
About Quoting:
- The escape character \ in Bash is used to continue the next line part of code to the original. This skips the next line command and rather treats the remaining characters after the character part of the same line.
